## NLP Webapp

The repo contains the code files for a webapp I'm writing as I follow along the book [Building Machine Learning Powered Applications]() by Emmanuel Ameisen.

The code closely follows the structure of the code presented in the book, with parts swapped/replaced/omitted as I try to build a functional and deployable web app that lets user write better questions.
